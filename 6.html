    <p class="text-black-10"><span class="text-2xl">His saga is the entrepreneurial creation myth</span>writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parents’ garage in 1976,
        was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in
        1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the
        world’s most valuable company. Along the way he helped to transform
        seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, phones,
        tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus
        belongs in the pantheon of America’s great innovators, along with
        Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a
        saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will
        remember how they applied imagination to technology and business.</p>

<p>One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most of
    the book, I asked him again about his tendency to be rough on people.
    “Look at the results,” he replied. “These are all smart people I work
    with, and any of them could get a top job at another place if they
    were truly feeling brutalized. But they don’t.” Then he paused for a
    few moments and said, almost wistfully, “And we got some amazing
    things done.” Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of hits over the
    past dozen years that was greater than that of any other innovative
    company in modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple
    Stores, MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion—not to mention
    every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was
    surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had been
    inspired by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and four
    children.</p>
